SocketPP is a very simple API with TCP and UDP socket implementatins for C++, both for client and server. They are provided by the following classes:
* [TCPClientSocket](TCPBaseSocket.h#L39): TCP client socket ([demo](client.cpp))
* [TCPServerSocket](TCPBaseSocket.h#L73): TCP server socket ([demo](server.cpp))
* [UDPSocket](UDPSocket.h#L22): UDP socket ([client demo](uclient.cpp) and [server demo](userver.cpp))
